# AdventOfCode-2022

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenges, written with Python.
My goal is to optimize to find a soluton that executes in under 1 second.


## Usage
Navigate to the directory of the day you want to run, and execute python script

Each day has a directory containing a python script with the same name as the day.

Example:
```day1/day1.py```

## Timing
In the [timing](timing/) directory, you can find the time it took to run each day's solution and a script to generate a report (```timing.txt```).
